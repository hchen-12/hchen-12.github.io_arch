# Introduction
My name is Holly Chen and I am a mechanical engineering masters student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of the Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab where I conduct research on wearable sensor design and validation for patient rehabilitation monitoring. Aside from my area of research, I enjoy product prototyping, iteration and design.

# Projects
### Capacitive Sensing Smart Garment
Overview: The goal of this research project is to develop and validate a capacitive sensing wearable smart garment for measuring muscle activity during movement. Current measurement tools for monitoring human biomechanics include EMG sensors and marker based motion capture which are expensive and require technical training for use making them inaccessible for the general public. The capacitive sensing sleeve is an alternative low-cost wearable sensor that can measure biomechanics information such as muscle activity during movement and isometric contractions. Capacitive sensing sleeves allow for muscle monitoring in out of lab environments and have the potential to increase quality and accessibility to sports performance enhancement and rehabilitation. Increasing the ease of biomechanics health monitoring could help detect and mitigate common musculoskeletal diseases and reduce the chance of injury for all types of people.

Personal contributions: I worked on design development for improving signal sensitivity and robustness through material variations. Additionally, I have led human studies data collections for signal validation with participants who have healthy and pathological gaits. Once data is collected, I conduct analysis through comparison between processed CS data and OpenSim marker mocap simulations.

### Haptic Hand - Virtual Object Rendering
Overview: The goal of this project was to design and implement a low-cost, 3D-printed haptic device that provides force feedback for hand interactions with virtual objects. The human hand is capable of performing many complex tasks, but relies on feedback to execute them successfully. Kinesthetic feedback, which provides force information, is one method to improve human proprioception. While many haptic devices with force feedback exist, they are often expensive and unable to render sufficient forces in multiple directions. The haptic hand is a haptic feedback system that consists of three mechanical subsystems that interface with a user’s thumb and two fingers. Interactions between the fingers and objects of different sizes and stiffnesses can be visualized in a GUI. This research provides validation of an affordable, easily manufactured haptic device that is accessible and can be used for educational purposes.

Personal contributions: I was part of the finger subteam that designed a capstan mechanism for a 3-DOF force feedback system for the pointer and middle finger. My work included calculating linkage lengths, and the appropriate radius for the capstans as well as CADing the mechanism components and coding the force feedback controls. I also contributed to the full system integration between the 2 finger mechanisms and the delta thumb mechanism. 

### Vertical Axis Wind Turbine
Overview: The goal of this project was to design and build a vertical axis wind turbine for deployment in an urban environment with an annual wind speed of 3-5 m/s. The purpose of building a physical prototype was to help validate a simulation software called HAWC2 (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine Simulation Code 2nd Generation), an aeroelastic code that measures the time response of a wind turbine. Traditional wind turbine designs found in wind farms are horizontal axis wind turbines that are optimized to generate power when wind is flowing in a specific direction. This is an effective design in areas that have a consistent wind flow, but less effective in locations where wind is turbulent and changes directions. Vertical axis wind turbines overcome the directional limitations of their horizontal counterparts as they are able to generate energy for wind moving in any direction. 

Personal contributions: My focus for this team project was to set up a digital twin of our physical prototype in HAWC2 to run validation tests between the software and the physical turbine. I also contributed to the design and fabrication of the VAWT base and turbine blades as well as the entire system assembly. 

### [Expanding Table] (https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/expandingtable/home?authuser=0)
Overview: The goal of this project was to design and build a round table that expands and contracts. Expandable tables have been around for centuries and include a range of mechanical elements that power their movement. They allow for additional people to be seated around an increased perimeter, or more items to be stored on a larger surface area, while also functioning at a compact and space efficient size. In this project, we explored various mechanisms that go into an expanding table, and combined them to create a table that rotates to expand and contract. In the table's contracted state, it is 30" in diameter. When a user spins the rotating base section, the table expands to a diameter of 40" while maintaining the same height. 

Personal contributions: The team collaboratively participated in the design brainstorming and iteration phase of this expanding table. Once the design was finalized, I worked on the inner-leaf subteam to create the mechanism that raised the inner table during rotation. I also contributed to the wood cutting fabrication as well as the full table assembly.
